## ü§î What Happened?
Retrac hired a developer named **Random** to maintain their anti-cheat system. Despite his well-known history of code theft, hack development, and illegal activities, both past and present, Retrac chose to protect their game instead of addressing his shady background and taking precautions to ensure the community's safety.

Behind the scenes, **Random** created a **file grabber** to steal users' files and personal information. Later, another Retrac owner, **Blurr**, publicly released this malicious file to over **170,000** players, which could have even more harmful features, potentially destroying computers and doing more than just stealing files.

## üìú Retrac Owner History

**Eccentric** *(formerly known as **"Zombie Man"**)*, the current owner of Retrac, has a shady history. He previously worked on a project called **FMod**, which was shut down after he **ADDED A VIRUS** into its launcher. This action led to the project‚Äôs shutdown shortly after he completely nuked the entire Discord server (***Can be Found in the Evidence Category Below***). His actions ruined the project for personal gain, obtaining thousands of dollars' worth of assets and more, the full extent of which is still unknown.

#### Evidence Against Eccentric:
- **[Interrogation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHSNBqQAB4o):** FMod‚Äôs owner confronts Eccentric, who evasively responds with "Loads of Nitro," implying **Data Theft** and **Fraud**.
- **[Server Nuke Footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_pzL4rXhzY):** Proof of FMod‚Äôs Discord server being Nuked by **Eccentric** (*Owner of Retrac*).
- **[Virus Proof](https://x.com/gmatrixgames/status/1672607940585353216):** **GMatrixGames** exposed the malicious activity by reverse-engineering the virus and providing clear proof of its harmful intent.

(*FMod had over **3,000 concurrent players**, more than three times Retrac‚Äôs peak count.*)

Eccentric‚Äôs virus targeted sensitive data, including billing information, Discord payment details, Epic Games sessions, and browser data. He also developed cheats, spread hate speech, deployed RATs (Remote Access Trojans), and stole Discord Nitro. His actions sabotaged legitimate projects for **personal gain** and impacted over **150,000** users.

## üö´ Why Retrac Is Not Safe

Retrac knowingly allowed this virus to spread without implementing **any security measures**, making it a major **security threat**.

They concealed the virus, refusing to issue any warnings or announcements, and prioritized their **reputation** and player count over user safety. Their primary motivations seem to be **money** and **fame**.

Given Eccentric‚Äôs history and his full access to Retrac‚Äôs launcher, source code, and servers, **Retrac is unsafe**.

In addition, they targeted a popular server, scraped its data, and destroyed over **two years of hard work**, causing significant financial damage, all without offering compensation. Their response?  
**"Not our problem."**
