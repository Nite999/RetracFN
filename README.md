## 🤔 What Happened?
Retrac hired a developer known as **Random** to manage their anti-cheat system — despite his **well-known history** of:
- Code theft  
- Hack development  
- Malware creation  
- And other illegal activity  

Instead of protecting their users, Retrac prioritized **numbers and revenue**, allowing Random to create a **malicious file grabber** that:
- Stole users’ personal files
- Logged sensitive data  
- Was later **publicly distributed** by Retrac co-owner **Blurr** to **170,000+ players**  

This malware had capabilities beyond spying — it could **destroy entire systems**.

- **Nuked the Discord server**  
- **Stole thousands in assets**
